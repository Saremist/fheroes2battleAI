Map:  Betrayal

This map is meant explicitly to be played by two players in an alliance.  I suppose it would be possible to play with one player, but I'd imagine it would be somewhat of a trial to have to deal with the brain-dead computer player as an ally.  If you do play alone, you will probably have to crush your ally in battle eventually to make use of its castles and resources in an effective way, but at least you can do it at your leisure without fear of your ally retaliating and trying to take your towns.

This map is meant as much for exploring as it is for fighting, as many of my large maps are.  I don't have any interest in High Scores, myself - I prefer to linger over a map and savor its every nook and cranny, even if it does mean I pull a worse score for it.  

The Hideous Mask events on the islands are kind of a parody of the sort of events I see in a lot of maps.  I always find it somewhat obnoxious when you run into an event that tells you that you've done something incredibly stupid (you have no say in the matter, of course) and, as a consequence, you are stuck with a cursed artifact or a loss of resources.  The Island events are a running gag that, I hope, you'll find as amusing as I did.  

I find that I'm much more capable of coming up with Triva Questions than I am with Riddles.

One other thing- you can get your Diplomat character back (and her experience + talents, plus her somewhat dubious artifact) for relatively cheap if you attack your jailer and surrender.  I have discovered that the Surrender option really can be quite handy in the game, believe it or not, and the next map I'm planning hinges on a crucial surrender...

Your Diplomat will give you a good look at what the computer player does with its time when it's alone.  I found it quite educational.
