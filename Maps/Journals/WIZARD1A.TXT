... as the last titan falls, Mandalis screams and runs into his tower. You and your troops enter through the ruined walls and pursue him. As you enter his inner sanctum, you see Mandalis lying on the floor, looking old and tired.  
   He rasps, "You won, apprentice. My power is spent. But even as I die, know that your victory is short-lived. You, too, will feel the power of magic. You, too, will desire it above all else. You are not so different from me, Solmyr. The greed for power will rule your life..." 
   You frown at him. "You are wrong, old man. There is a difference between us. You desired magical power so that you could have everything for yourself. I desire it because I want to use it for the good of all, as magic is meant to be used. For are not the magical forces all around us, there for all to enjoy? Even if only a select few can tap into it, it does not mean that only they can have it." Mystical words form on your lips as your hands move in the arcane gestures required for a lightning bolt spell. "And now, Mandalis, it is past time for you to go to eternal rest..."

   Trumpets were played as you were proclaimed ruler of the land, by titan and dragon alike. Your first proclamation was the following: Let all live in comfort and friendship in this land, with no creature considered below another.  And let any whom desires so learn the secrets of magecraft, to use as they will for themselves and for others. Even as a wizard is king, still no wizard shall be considered above other people purely by the virtue of his magical power. For the forces of magic are interwoven with the forces of nature, and nature is there for each and every creature."
And so the kingdom prospered.
Until one day...
