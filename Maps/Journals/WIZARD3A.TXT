...Iciria screamed and fled into the depths of the Ice Castle. Solmyr and his titans pursued her. As they rushed into the great hall, they saw Iciria clutching at an arrow in her chest. She wailed as her body slowly turned to ice, then melted and became steam. The steam finally evaporated, leaving no trace of the Ice Queen...
   Looking around, Solmyr saw a figure in a dark doorway, holding a bow. Then the figure stepped forward. Solmyr gaped in astonishment. She was the most beautiful elven maiden he'd even seen. Her red hair flowed down her shoulders and back like the finest silk, and her green eyes were stern and proud, but also kind and compassionate. Solmyr could not do anything except stare at her as if enchanted.

   As she spoke, she seemed to look at Solmyr with more than just cursory interest... And then Solmyr knew that this was the maiden he had sought, for she was obviously both beautiful and skilled in more than one craft...

...As the wedding bells were ringing, Solmyr and Diana were declared husband and wife. As the news were proclaimed throughout the kingdom, the people knew that this was not only the joy of their ruler, but also theirs, for with this wedding came the union of elves and people of Magistar, to live together in eternal peace...
